**Introduction**

My fascination for an algorithmic and machine learning approach to horse race betting was born after reading an article titled "The Gambler Who Cracked the Horse Racing Code"(1) in late 2018. An enthralling read, the article catalogues the life of Bill Benter and his journey in becoming one of the most prolific and profitable algorithmic sports betting icons of all time. The article left a prolific impression on me and has since driven me to investigate other statistical and algorithmic approaches to betting including Texas Hold'em and Blackjack.
